== Installation ==

1. Upload the `table-rate-shipping-for-woocommerce` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Activate the shipping method by going to WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Table Rate
4. Tick 'Enable this shipping method'
5. Configure your shipping rates and hit 'Save changes' when finished

After adding a shipping zone (country group), remember to hit 'Save changes' before proceeding to use it in a table rate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What currencies / weight units / languages are supported? =

The plugin is compatible with any WooCommerce supported currency/weight unit. Language translations will be added in a future update.

= How does the 'Everywhere Else' zone work? =

When a table rate uses 'Everywhere Else' as its zone, the table rate will only be applicable if the destination country does not appear in any defined shipping zone.

= I just want to calculate shipping costs based on destination, can I do this? =

Yes, just create a table rate using the zone, enter '0' for min and '*' for max. This will capture all carts destined for that shipping zone. '*' can be used in any max column to indicate there is no upper limit.

= What if multiple table rates are applicable for a cart?  =

The cheapest applicable rate will be chosen automatically for the customer.

= I receive an 'Action failed' error after adding over 100 rates?  =

The error is due to a limit imposed by your server setup with regards to how much data you can send. Find your `php.ini` file and increase the setting called `max_input_vars` to at least 5000.
